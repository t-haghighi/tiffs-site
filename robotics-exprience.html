  <ul>
  <li>Intro to enginerring principals</li>
  <p>The basic engineering cycle (I find it more of a thought process) every person going into any kind of engineering will become accustomed to and live by as they spend more time<br/>building things. I had zero expierence with any kind of building before and learning the engineering cycle and how to process thoughts differently was a challenge.<br/>Of course the only way to get around this challenge is to follow the engineering cycle (aka learning Mechanical Principals, forces, how to use gears, gear trains, etc.),<br/>ask for help, take notes (writing what happend in a language that makes sense to you, drawing pictures, color coating, etc.)and more interaction with your project that your working on.</p>
  <li>Gear trains</li>
  <p> Gears can be used to make the fast object like a drag racer or something with more pulling power such as a tractor.<br/>Personally i haven't mastered the complete ideology of using complex gear trains but understand the basic concept. <br/>Faster movement you would want to have the driver gear to be larger and the follower gear to be smaller creating a 2:1 ratio or larger (the ratio can be found by counting the number of teeth and inputting it in thr formula: n2/n1, n being the number of teeth).
  <li>Object manipulations</li>
  <p>Picking up and moving something may seem like an easy task but you need to take into account, what is the size of the object you are moving, do you need to store it on the robot, does it need to be droped off, etc. (this is the first part of the enginerring process, defining the problem). My expierence with maipulating onjects was a pair effort i which i worked on the pick up, storage and drop off system. i identified that i needed to aim, pick up, store and drop the raquet balls into a specific area. I decided to go with an escalator design hwere there was a guiding tank tread above. Once it went up the cage like escalator it entered aother but this time parallel to the ground.
