<h4>HTML</h4>
  <p>My expiercence with HTML was a short and quick one, it is probably the most simple scripting language. However, all languages have their difficulties, I most definietly did find them in HTML, mostly in regards to learning how to use CSS. I am glad to say that I created this website to display my knowldege of HTML and CSS. Once I go the hang of HTML and a general understanding of coding, I was able learn other languages much eaiser.</p> 
<h4>Python</h4>
  <p>A more difficult language to learn because it has more factors, that are all logic based aspects such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Variables/strings</li>
      <li>Data Types</li>
      <li>Tuples</li>
      <li>If Then Statments</li> 
<h4>Robot C</h4>
      <p> I started learning this language for the ptinicpals of Engineering class which I am enrolled in at my school. I have found that it is similar to python with logic and loops. Currently I am researching into how to write code for a marbel sorter to display our program in an upcoming community event.</p>
